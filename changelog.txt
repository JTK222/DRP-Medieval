This version is extremely unstable, use at your own risk!
A lot of things are not ported yet/will be removed.
(You can find a list of them bellow, most will be re-introduced later)
Crafting is not available in this version.
As well as most blocks don't drop anything.
There may be bugs, and the performance may not be great.

Changes in v0.4.3
* Fixed most missing textures and models (needs latest version of MARG
+ Added 4(1 but rotated in all 4 directions) new Timbering Pattern
* Fixed most missing Translations, the remaining ones will be fixed by a future MARG update
+ Added Timbering Notes, you can use those to add Timbering to your timbered clay walls (not finished yet, just a prototype)
